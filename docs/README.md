## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3 with SCSS
- Flexbox / CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM
- Vanilla Javascript
- GSAP && ScrollTrigger for animations

### What I learned

I learned a lot about GSAP and OOP in JavaScript. Also now I'm better at using import/export modules.

### Continued development

Maybe I'll come back in the future to improve this project.
